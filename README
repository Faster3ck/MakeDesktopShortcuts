MakeDesktopShortcuts is a service menu extension for Dolphin
that allows you to add quickly desktop shortcuts of one or more
folders with a mouse click.
More precisely, it doesn't create any symbolic link
but it generates a .desktop file launcher that points to the selected folder.

Installation:
-------------
As root run sh install.sh

Usage:
-------------
Select one or more folders, right click on these folders and, from the popup menu, click on
Actions->Create shortcut->To desktop
